# CAP Benchmarks - Modified Version

This repository contains the code used for testing in our research article. 
The code is based on the CAP Benchmarks project, originally developed by the 
team at [CART-PUC Minas](https://github.com/cart-pucminas/CAPBenchmarks).

## About CAP Benchmarks

CAP Benchmarks is a comprehensive suite designed to evaluate various aspects of 
computer architecture performance. The original repository can be found 
[here](https://github.com/cart-pucminas/CAPBenchmarks). 

## Modifications

This repository includes modifications to the original CAP Benchmarks code, 
focusing specifically on loop unrolling optimizations.The optimizations have
been carefully implemented and tested to ensure they provide measurable 
improvements without altering the fundamental behavior of the benchmarks.
